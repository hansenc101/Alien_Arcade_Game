Bugs: 
1) When transitioning between levels, the appropriate message slightly glitches.
2) When dying on level 2, it glitches worse, and has trouble deciding which alien texture to use.

NOTICE: The kill count will only reset if you lose the game, that way, you can continue playing the game and see how many kills you can rack up
without losing the game. 

Good job overall; need to comment what's going on in each of the functions
